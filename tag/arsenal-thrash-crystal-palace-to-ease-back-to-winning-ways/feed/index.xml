										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Arsenal&#8217;s Brazilian defender #06 Gabriel Magalhaes celebrates after scoring his team first goal during the English Premier League football match between Arsenal and Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium in London on January 20, 2024. Photo: AFP Arsenal breathed new life into their Premier League title challenge as a 5-0 win over Crystal Palace got the Gunners back to winning ways. Centre-back Gabriel did most of the damage before half-time as he headed in the opener then forced Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson into an own goal. Leandro Trossard made it 3-0 on the hour mark before substitute Gabriel Martinelli struck twice in stoppage time. Victory moves Mikel Arteta&#8217;s men level with Manchester City and Aston Villa, two points behind leaders Liverpool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Arsenal had won just once in seven games prior to a two-week winter break. However, a warm weather training camp in Dubai looked to have refreshed last season&#8217;s runners-up, even if they did have very obliging visitors in struggling Palace. The Eagles have won just once in 12 games to leave them still perilously poised above the relegation zone and pile the pressure on 76-year-old boss Roy Hodgson. Arsenal&#8217;s lack of a natural goalscorer up front has been scrutinised during their downturn in form and the fact it was one of his defenders that ended a barren run in front of goal will remain a concern for Arteta. No side has scored more goals from set pieces in the Premier League this season than Arsenal and it was two corners that undid Palace before half-time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gabriel outmuscled Chris Richards to rise highest to meet Declan Rice&#8217;s delivery with a downward header to settle the home side&#8217;s nerves just 11 minutes in. Palace were largely restricted to pot shots from long range as Jefferson Lerma tested David Raya after the goalkeeper&#8217;s poor clearance gifted possession to the Colombian. But they did not learn their lesson as Gabriel again got ahead of Richards to meet Bukayo Saka&#8217;s corner and the ball rebounded in off the unfortunate Henderson. Hodgson was booed by his own fans after substituting Eberechi Eze during Wednesday&#8217;s 1-0 FA Cup defeat at Everton to keep the England international fresh for the trip to the Emirates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The closest Eze came to making an impact was another long-range effort that Raya was forced to turn behind. But to compound Palace&#8217;s set-piece shambles, they then conceded from one of their own. Raya collected a cross into the box and quickly set Gabriel Jesus galloping free on the counter-attack. The Brazilian crossed for Trossard, who kept his cool to cut inside Nathanial Clyne and smash home his seventh goal of the season. Defeat leaves Palace still five points above the relegation zone. And a banner unfurled in the away end in the closing stages will do little to help Hodgson&#8217;s case to remain until the end of the season. &#8220;Wasted potential on and off the pitch, weak decisions taking us backwards,&#8221; was the message from the Palace fans aimed at co-owner and chairman Steve Parish. Martinelli rubbed salt in the wounds by coming off the bench to score twice in stoppage time. The Brazilian had been dropped after scoring just two goals in the Premier League all season. But he doubled that tally in a matter of seconds as he twice coolly slotted past Henderson into the far corner.</p>
