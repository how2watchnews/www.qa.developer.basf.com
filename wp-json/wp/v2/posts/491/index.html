I was diagnosed with typhoid and dengue, both. I am doing a bit better now. But I plan to leave my job and go to my village home once my condition improves, as where I live and work right now in the city \u2013 Matuail \u2013 lacks anti-mosquito activities,&#8221; said Sakib. Like Sakib, many patients at DMCH are being treated on the floor due to a scarcity of beds.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Riaz Uddin, a doctor at the medicine ward, said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t send back patients who are in a critical stage with such warning signs, comorbidity patients, or those in high risk. As we have a scarcity of beds, we are trying to make space on the floor in order to ensure their treatment,&#8221; he said. HM Nazmul Ahsan, associate professor at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, said immediate hospitalisation is required if a patient experiences severe stomach aches, breathing difficulty, severe weakness, vomiting, and\/or bleeding from gums and nose.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If a patient is not hospitalised within 24 hours [of these symptoms surfacing], they may go into dengue shock syndrome. Zaheda Begum, an aunt of Abir, 15, who has been in DMCH since Saturday, said they also had to get a mat to use as a bed on the floor for him. However, with continuous treatment, Abir is doing well now.&#8221; Morshed Alam, 30, a resident of Cumilla&#8217;s Daudkandi, was admitted to DMCH with dengue on Sunday and was about to get his treatment started after his test reports were available. But as I wasplaced on the floor, my test reports, along with my mobile phone, were all stolen.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile, a doctor died of dengue fever at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) in the early hours ofyesterday. Almina Dewan Mishu, 32, was a 39th BCS cadre officer. She had been under treatment at the hospital&#8217;s ICU since August 1.
