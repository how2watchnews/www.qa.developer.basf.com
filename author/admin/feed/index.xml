										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The images a reconnaissance drone sent back to Ukrainian forces provided a vivid portrait of the Russian side of the war zone. Damaged houses gave way to cratered fields on Ukraine’s southern steppe. There was burned-out armor in a scorched forest. A jagged Russian trench along a tree line had been blasted by American-supplied cluster munitions barely a week earlier, according to Lt. Ashot Arutiunian, the commander of the unit that recorded the images.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He pointed to holes in the roofs of several large agricultural buildings in a village and said they had most likely been hit by the American-made HIMARS rocket system; it is known for its accuracy, and there was no damage to surrounding buildings or to a nearby church. This was on a recent morning, with Ukrainian artillery firing relentlessly, the deep rumbling explosions of the impact resonating in the distance. Mixed in were the louder explosions of Russian shells landing on Ukrainian positions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But Lieutenant Arutiunian was focused on the skies above. Drones have become a mainstay used by both Russian and Ukrainian forces, reconnoitering the battlefield and directing fire against enemy targets. Lieutenant Arutiunian, who uses the military call sign Doc — a reference to the doctorate in data mining he holds from Kyiv Polytechnic — commands four teams in the unmanned aerial vehicle service of the Ukrainian Volunteer Army, operating on the southern front. They deploy a variety of propeller-driven drones and planes to track Russian forces for the Ukrainian military and are constantly adjusting tactics and equipment to evade Russian interceptors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, one of the units allowed a team of New York Times journalists to accompany it on a mission close to the front line as it sent a drone into Russian-occupied territory to surveil the battlefront. A condition was that the unit’s precise location could not be reported. Amid a background of artillery fire, the team got to work under cover of a small copse of trees, unpacking equipment and setting up four antennas; those were needed to work round the threats of both Russian and Ukrainian electronic jammers that can swiftly end the flight of a drone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fixed wing craft the unit’s members were using was equipped with two cameras and an independent global positioning system as backup, to give the pilot several options to bring it home should one or more of the systems fail. In this reconnaissance mission we are investigating the terrain, Lieutenant Arutiunian said. Later, back at base, they would examine the video footage on a big monitor to try to spot Russian military, he said: “We are looking for soldiers, warehouses, gasoline depots, whatever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Eleven-year-old Saima was excited about getting a sibling in just two months. Yet here, she is being consoled by a relative as she wails, having learned that her eight-month-pregnant mother Farzana just died from dengue in Mugda Medical College Hospital’s ICU yesterday morning.PHOTO: ANISUR RAHMAN Twenty-year-old Mohammad Sakib was admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital on Sunday as he was experiencing severe weakness a dengue symptom that is considered a &#8220;warning sign&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, as there was not a single bed available, his father had to buy a mat for him to be placed on the floor of the medicine unit, where he is still undergoing treatment. I was diagnosed with typhoid and dengue, both. I am doing a bit better now. But I plan to leave my job and go to my village home once my condition improves, as where I live and work right now in the city – Matuail – lacks anti-mosquito activities,&#8221; said Sakib. Like Sakib, many patients at DMCH are being treated on the floor due to a scarcity of beds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Riaz Uddin, a doctor at the medicine ward, said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t send back patients who are in a critical stage with such warning signs, comorbidity patients, or those in high risk. As we have a scarcity of beds, we are trying to make space on the floor in order to ensure their treatment,&#8221; he said. HM Nazmul Ahsan, associate professor at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, said immediate hospitalisation is required if a patient experiences severe stomach aches, breathing difficulty, severe weakness, vomiting, and/or bleeding from gums and nose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If a patient is not hospitalised within 24 hours [of these symptoms surfacing], they may go into dengue shock syndrome. Zaheda Begum, an aunt of Abir, 15, who has been in DMCH since Saturday, said they also had to get a mat to use as a bed on the floor for him. However, with continuous treatment, Abir is doing well now.&#8221; Morshed Alam, 30, a resident of Cumilla&#8217;s Daudkandi, was admitted to DMCH with dengue on Sunday and was about to get his treatment started after his test reports were available. But as I wasplaced on the floor, my test reports, along with my mobile phone, were all stolen.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, a doctor died of dengue fever at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) in the early hours ofyesterday. Almina Dewan Mishu, 32, was a 39th BCS cadre officer. She had been under treatment at the hospital&#8217;s ICU since August 1. Earlier, she was at a private hospital after being diagnosed with dengue on July 26, and then was transferred to DMCH as her condition deteriorated. She was declared dead around 5:30am, DMCH Director Brig Gen Md Nazmul Haque told The Daily Star.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She was buried at her ancestral graveyard in Narayanganj&#8217;s Kanchan municipality. The Directorate General of Health Services expressed deep condolences at the death. According to the DGHS, with the deaths of Almina and 12 others yesterday, the number of dengue fatalities rose to 340, of which 194 are female and 146 are male. Eleven of the deaths occurred in Dhaka city. Meanwhile, 2,742 dengue patients were hospitalised across the country in the last 24 hours till yesterday morning, bringing the total number of cases to 72,225.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Arsenal&#8217;s Brazilian defender #06 Gabriel Magalhaes celebrates after scoring his team first goal during the English Premier League football match between Arsenal and Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium in London on January 20, 2024. Photo: AFP Arsenal breathed new life into their Premier League title challenge as a 5-0 win over Crystal Palace got the Gunners back to winning ways. Centre-back Gabriel did most of the damage before half-time as he headed in the opener then forced Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson into an own goal. Leandro Trossard made it 3-0 on the hour mark before substitute Gabriel Martinelli struck twice in stoppage time. Victory moves Mikel Arteta&#8217;s men level with Manchester City and Aston Villa, two points behind leaders Liverpool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Arsenal had won just once in seven games prior to a two-week winter break. However, a warm weather training camp in Dubai looked to have refreshed last season&#8217;s runners-up, even if they did have very obliging visitors in struggling Palace. The Eagles have won just once in 12 games to leave them still perilously poised above the relegation zone and pile the pressure on 76-year-old boss Roy Hodgson. Arsenal&#8217;s lack of a natural goalscorer up front has been scrutinised during their downturn in form and the fact it was one of his defenders that ended a barren run in front of goal will remain a concern for Arteta. No side has scored more goals from set pieces in the Premier League this season than Arsenal and it was two corners that undid Palace before half-time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gabriel outmuscled Chris Richards to rise highest to meet Declan Rice&#8217;s delivery with a downward header to settle the home side&#8217;s nerves just 11 minutes in. Palace were largely restricted to pot shots from long range as Jefferson Lerma tested David Raya after the goalkeeper&#8217;s poor clearance gifted possession to the Colombian. But they did not learn their lesson as Gabriel again got ahead of Richards to meet Bukayo Saka&#8217;s corner and the ball rebounded in off the unfortunate Henderson. Hodgson was booed by his own fans after substituting Eberechi Eze during Wednesday&#8217;s 1-0 FA Cup defeat at Everton to keep the England international fresh for the trip to the Emirates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The closest Eze came to making an impact was another long-range effort that Raya was forced to turn behind. But to compound Palace&#8217;s set-piece shambles, they then conceded from one of their own. Raya collected a cross into the box and quickly set Gabriel Jesus galloping free on the counter-attack. The Brazilian crossed for Trossard, who kept his cool to cut inside Nathanial Clyne and smash home his seventh goal of the season. Defeat leaves Palace still five points above the relegation zone. And a banner unfurled in the away end in the closing stages will do little to help Hodgson&#8217;s case to remain until the end of the season. &#8220;Wasted potential on and off the pitch, weak decisions taking us backwards,&#8221; was the message from the Palace fans aimed at co-owner and chairman Steve Parish. Martinelli rubbed salt in the wounds by coming off the bench to score twice in stoppage time. The Brazilian had been dropped after scoring just two goals in the Premier League all season. But he doubled that tally in a matter of seconds as he twice coolly slotted past Henderson into the far corner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Top seed Iga Swiatek crashed out of the Australian Open on Saturday, losing 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to Czech teenager Linda Noskova in the third round as her bid for a maiden Melbourne Park title and fifth Grand Slam trophy fell apart. The Pole, more accustomed to breezing past opponents with the odd &#8220;bagel&#8221; or 6-0 scoreline thrown in, had struggled in Melbourne, enduring a first-set tiebreak in her opener against Sofia Kenin before fighting back from the brink of defeat to oust Danielle Collins last time out. Noskova, 19, emerged as a tricky third-round opponent with three top-10 wins under her belt, but Swiatek looked in no mood to be dragged into another dogfight as she broke in the sixth game and held to love in the next to take charge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 22-year-old barely let the intensity drop after taking the first set as she forced Melbourne Park debutant Noskova into uncomfortable positions in the second by working the angles and launching big forehands. But the Czech held firm, responding with some explosive hitting of her own and breaking en route to levelling up the contest before heaping the pressure on the four-times major champion to take a 2-1 lead in the decider. Swiatek looked to have composed herself during a brief pause in play as doctors attended to a sick supporter in the crowd and broke back, but Noskova did not relent and got her nose in front again to close out the match on serve and complete a huge upset.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The much-anticipated trailer of Nisho, Mehazabien starrer &#8220;Neel Joler Kabbyo&#8221; is set to release on Thursday. The Shihab Shaheen directorial web-film is scheduled to be released on the popular OTT platform iScreen on November 16.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Poster of the film</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the immense success of the web-film &#8220;Redrum&#8221;, the Afran Nisho and Mehazabien Chowdhury duo were not seen in any OTT content together. They will however come together for this web-film by Shihab Shaheen. The platform had already revealed the first poster of the film on November 1, on their social media. The poster shows Mehazabien and Nisho standing by the seashore, holding hands, during the twilight hours. Confirming the release, director Shihab Shaheen said, &#8220;The audience will get to see a fantastic story in this film. Besides, Nisho and Mehazabien have a dedicated fan base. I believe that even the general audience will enjoy the content.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I want to compete with none but myself: Tania Brishty</strong><br />
&#8220;The web-film will center around one of its protagonists – a girl&#8217;s fascination for the sea. When we were shooting this, OTT platforms were not popular. During and post-pandemic it had and has been rising in demand. Also, we had to cancel the shooting of this project four times. Later, this web-film was produced for iScreen,&#8221; the director further added.</p>
